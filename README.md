# The-Three-Light-Bulbs

You are in a room with three switches, each of which corresponds to one of the three light bulbs in the next room. Your task is to determine which switch operates which bulb. All lights are initially off, and you can't see into one room from the other. You are allowed to go into the room with the light bulbs only once, and you can't change the switches once you've left the switch room. How can you determine which switch corresponds to which light bulb?

Solution :
Turn on the first switch and wait for a few minutes. Then turn it off and turn on the second switch. Walk into the room with the bulbs. The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch, the bulb that is off and still warm corresponds to the first switch, and the bulb that is both off and cool corresponds to the third switch.
